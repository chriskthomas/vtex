# vtex

This is a minimal version of LaTeX I created so that I can regenerate my resume. The repository consists of a single bash file. This file downloads [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) and [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). It then installs the particular packages that I need to generate my resume.

These files can be changed on line 29 of `generate.bash`.
